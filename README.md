#### An approach in Tensorflow to solve the Sentence-Cloze-Task 

A four-sentence short story and two alternatives for the last, fifth sentence that ends the story are given. The system needs to decide which of the two is correct. The training data consists of five-sentence short stories that include the correct ending but there is no incorrect ending given.
